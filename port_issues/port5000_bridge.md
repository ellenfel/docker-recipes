Potential Impact of Changing Ports
Existing Clients or Integrations:

If any clients, scripts, or systems are hardcoded to connect to port 5000, they will fail to connect to the second container after the port change.
Configuration Updates Needed:

Any dependent services or clients connecting to the second container must be updated to use the new port (5001).
Alternative Solutions
If you want to avoid breaking existing connections, consider one of these approaches:

1. Use Different Network Interfaces
Bind each container to a different network interface (e.g., different IP addresses on the same host). For example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
ports:
    - "192.168.1.10:5000:5000" # First container
    - "192.168.1.11:5000:5000" # Second container
Ensure the host machine has multiple IP addresses (e.g., via aliasing or additional network interfaces).
This keeps the same port (5000) but differentiates by IP address.
2. Use Docker Networks
Set up a custom Docker network for each container, exposing their ports only within those networks:

yaml
Copy
Edit
networks:
  tb-network-1:
    driver: bridge
  tb-network-2:
    driver: bridge
Assign each container to a different network without exposing host ports. Communicate between containers by name.

3. Reverse Proxy
Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik to route requests to the correct container based on hostnames or paths. Example:

First container accessible at http://gateway1.example.com.
Second container accessible at http://gateway2.example.com.
The reverse proxy maps requests to the appropriate container's internal port (5000).

4. Keep the Same Port but Add Context
Modify only one container's connectors to avoid conflicting with existing integrations. For example:

Keep REST connector disabled in the second container if not used.
Update the relevant connectors to ensure unique usage without exposing port 5000.

Recommendation
If breaking existing connections is not acceptable:

Reverse Proxy is a robust and scalable solution.
Different Interfaces work well if you have multiple IPs.
Custom Networks are lightweight and ideal for isolated systems.
